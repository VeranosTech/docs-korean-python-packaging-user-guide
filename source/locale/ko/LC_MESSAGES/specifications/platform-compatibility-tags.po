"The scheme defined in :pep:`425` is insufficient for public distribution "
"of Linux wheel files (and \\*nix wheel files in general), so the "
"*manylinux* platform tags were defined, to allow providing wheels for "
"many common Linux distributions. See :pep:`513` for more about how this "
"works."

"``manylinux2010`` is defined in :pep:`571`, for x86_64 and i686 "
"architectures. It is based on a platform from 2010, whereas "
"``manylinux1`` is based on a platform from 2007. This means that "
"``manylinux2010`` packages are easier to create, but not compatible with "
"some older systems where ``manylinux1`` packages would work."
