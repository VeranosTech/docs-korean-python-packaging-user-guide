"`easy_install` was released in 2004, as part of :ref:`setuptools`.  It "
"was notable at the time for installing :term:`packages <Distribution "
"Package>` from :term:`PyPI <Python Package Index (PyPI)>` using "
"requirement specifiers, and automatically installing dependencies."

":ref:`pip` came later in 2008, as alternative to `easy_install`, although"
" still largely built on top of :ref:`setuptools` components.  It was "
"notable at the time for *not* installing packages as :term:`Eggs <Egg>` "
"or from :term:`Eggs <Egg>` (but rather simply as 'flat' packages from "
":term:`sdists <Source Distribution (or \"sdist\")>`), and introducing the"
" idea of :ref:`Requirements Files <pip:Requirements Files>`, which gave "
"users the power to easily replicate environments."
