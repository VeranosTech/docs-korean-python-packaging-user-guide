"`Pynsist <https://pypi.org/project/pynsist>`__ is a tool that bundles "
"Python programs together with the Python-interpreter into a single "
"installer based on NSIS. In most cases, packaging only requires the user "
"to choose a version of the Python-interpreter and declare the "
"dependencies of the program. The tool downloads the specified Python-"
"interpreter for Windows and packages it with all the dependencies in a "
"single Windows-executable installer."

msgid ""
"The installer installs or updates the Python-interpreter on the users "
"system, which can be used independently of the packaged program. The "
"program itself, can be started from a shortcut, that the installer places"
" in the start-menu. Uninstalling the program leaves the Python "
"installation of the user intact."

"A big advantage of pynsist is that the Windows packages can be built on "
"Linux. There are several examples for different kinds of programs "
"(console, GUI) in the `documentation <https://pynsist.readthedocs.io>`__."
" The tool is released under the MIT-licence."
