"Keep in mind that Python is used for a great many different purposes, and"

":ref:`Pipenv` is a dependency manager for Python projects. If you're "
"familiar with Node.js' `npm`_ or Ruby's `bundler`_, it is similar in "
"spirit to those tools. While :ref:`pip` alone is often sufficient for "
"personal use, Pipenv is recommended for collaborative projects as it's a "
"higher-level tool that simplifies dependency management for common use "
"cases."
