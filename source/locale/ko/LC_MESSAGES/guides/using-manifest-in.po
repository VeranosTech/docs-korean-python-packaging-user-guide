"When building a :term:`source distribution <Source Distribution (or "
"\"sdist\")>` for your package, by default only a minimal set of files are"
" included.  You may find yourself wanting to include extra files in the "
"source distribution, such as an authors/contributors file, a "
":file:`docs/` directory, or a directory of data files used for testing "
"purposes.  There may even be extra files that you *need* to include; for "
"example, if your :file:`setup.py` computes your project's "
"``long_description`` by reading from both a README and a changelog file, "
"you'll need to include both those files in the sdist so that people that "
"build or install from the sdist get the correct results."
